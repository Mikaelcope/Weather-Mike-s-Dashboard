# Weather-Mike-s-Dashboard
A dashboard displaying weather for the next 5 days in your selected city.

## Description
I have created a URL that has a weather report function based off of an input city. Users insert a city of choice and click search. This generates the weather report for the day as well as a forcast for the following 5 days. It extracts this information using API for the following website: https://openweathermap.org/ .

### Installation
Click on the following link to access the URL:
https://mikaelcope.github.io/Weather-Mike-s-Dashboard/


### Usage
Once the URL has loaded this is what you will see:

User can input a city of choice from around the world and click search. <br>
If the input is a calid city, both current weather and a 5 day forecast will be displayed.<br>
